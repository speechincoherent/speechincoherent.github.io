        <h1>ONLY ONE MONTH TILL CHRISTMAS RAHHHHHHHHHHh</h1> <br><br>
        <p>whats good, "people" who read this shit</p> <br>
        <p>im gonna be honest, i kinda forgot this website existed</p>
        <p>fortunately though, my friend <a href="../fellas/zodi.html">zodi</a> reminded me it</p> <br>
        <p>and that was pretty great, and also it brought attention to the VARIOUS bugs in my website</p>
        <p>so i got to fixing, and i realized that THE MORE BUGS I FIXED THE MORE I FUCKING FOUND I HATE CODING</p> <br>
        <p>is this what people who code as a job feel? is this how much it sucks?</p> <br>
        <p>anyways, stay tuned for the next 1-paragraph blog where i talk about my hate for swiss cheese</p>
