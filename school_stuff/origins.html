        <h6>Poem by William Lin</h6>
        <hr>
    <pre style="font-family:'Times New Roman', Times, serif;">
        I am from cigarettes,
		From Adidas clothing and McDonalds drive-throughs.
	I am from the shared downstairs bedroom
		Smoky, and full of windows, it was rarely quiet.
	I am from the outdoor playground
		And the white-netted soccer goal
		Which I’ve spent hours using,
	And days kicking about with
		Out in the grassy backyard.

	I’m from Chinese New Year and Asian traditions,
		From Xue and Wai Gong.
	I’m from the family road trips 
		And the Sunday barbecues.
		From working hard and staying strong
	I’m from never giving up 
		Even in the hardest times,
	And the toughest moments.

	I’m from the stunning atmosphere of La Bombonera, and the awe inspiring valleys of China,
		From my grandfather’s Braised pork and the soft texture of steamed rice.
	From the stunning nature of the Fuzhou province,
		And all the lengthy, and rocky paths my parents traveled across
	Just to get to see each other, face to face.

	I’m from all the intense- hardships we suffered
		And all the extraordinary things we accomplished
	To get to where we currently are today.
